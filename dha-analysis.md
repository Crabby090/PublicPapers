# Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) - Practical Guide

## Overview

The Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) is a framework within Critical Discourse Studies developed by Ruth Wodak and Martin Reisigl. It emphasizes interdisciplinary analysis, historical contextualization, and the principle of triangulation.

**When to use DHA:**
- Analyzing political rhetoric and policy discourse
- Investigating discrimination, identity construction, nationalism
- Tracing how discourse evolves over time
- Examining how language legitimizes or challenges power

## Core Principles

1. **Interdisciplinarity**: Integrate linguistics with history, political science, sociology
2. **Problem-orientation**: Focus on social problems manifest in discourse
3. **Recursivity**: Move iteratively between theory and empirical data
4. **Triangulation**: Use multiple sources, methods, theories, and background information
5. **Application**: Make results accessible to experts and the public

## The Eight-Stage Research Programme

DHA follows an eight-stage recursive process (Reisigl & Wodak 2009, 2016):

### Stage 1: Theoretical Preparation
- Review existing research on topic and discourse type
- Identify relevant theoretical frameworks
- Formulate initial research questions

**Output**: Annotated bibliography, theoretical framework document

### Stage 2: Data Collection
- Identify relevant discourses, discursive events, social fields, actors
- Collect texts across genres (speeches, policy documents, media, social media)
- Gather context information (historical, political, institutional)

**Output**: Corpus inventory with metadata

### Stage 3: Data Selection and Preparation
- Define selection criteria (time period, actors, genre)
- Downsize corpus to manageable analytical sample
- Transcribe audio/video; prepare texts for analysis

**Output**: Final analytical corpus, transcripts

### Stage 4: Contextual Analysis
- Research historical background
- Map institutional and political context
- Identify intertextual and interdiscursive relations

**Output**: Context document addressing four levels (see below)

### Stage 5: Qualitative Pilot Analysis
- Conduct initial close reading of key texts
- Test analytical categories
- Refine research questions

**Output**: Pilot analysis notes, refined analytical framework

### Stage 6: Detailed Case Studies
- Apply the five discursive strategies systematically
- Document findings with textual evidence
- Identify patterns across texts

**Output**: Completed analysis worksheets (see templates below)

### Stage 7: Formulation of Critique
- Apply three types of critique (text-immanent, socio-diagnostic, prospective)
- Synthesize findings
- Develop interpretive arguments

**Output**: Draft findings and interpretation

### Stage 8: Application and Dissemination
- Make results accessible
- Consider practical implications
- Communicate to relevant audiences

**Output**: Final paper, policy brief, or public communication

## Four Levels of Context

Analyze each text within four contextual dimensions:

| Level | Focus | Questions to Ask |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **1. Text-internal** | Immediate co-text, linguistic environment | What surrounds this passage? How does it connect to the rest of the text? |
| **2. Intertextual/Interdiscursive** | Relations to other texts, genres, discourses | What other texts are referenced? What discourses does this draw on? |
| **3. Situational/Institutional** | Social variables, institutional frames | Who produced this? For whom? In what institutional setting? |
| **4. Socio-political/Historical** | Broader context, power relations, history | What historical events are relevant? What political conditions shape this? |

## The Five Discursive Strategies

### Overview Table

| Strategy | Objective | Heuristic Question |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Nomination** | Construct and represent social actors, objects, events | How are persons/things named and referred to? |
| **Predication** | Label actors positively or negatively | What traits/qualities are attributed to them? |
| **Argumentation** | Justify and legitimize claims | What arguments are employed? What topoi? |
| **Perspectivization** | Express, position, or frame point of view | From what perspective are these expressed? |
| **Intensification/Mitigation** | Modify epistemic status, strengthen or weaken | How is the force of utterances modified? |

---

### Strategy 1: NOMINATION (Referential Strategy)

**Objective**: How social actors, objects, phenomena, events, processes, and actions are named and referred to linguistically.

**Linguistic Devices to Identify**:

| Device | Examples | What to Look For |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Membership categorization** | "Americans," "workers," "elites" | How are groups defined and bounded? |
| **Biological/naturalistic metaphors** | "flood of imports," "economic war" | Nature/body metaphors for social phenomena |
| **Deictics** | "we," "they," "here," "there," "now" | Who is included/excluded? |
| **Anthroponyms** | Names, titles, roles | How are specific actors referred to? |
| **Metonymy** | "Washington," "Beijing," "Wall Street" | Place for institution, part for whole |
| **Synecdoche** | "America" for government/people | Generalizations, totalization |
| **Euphemism/Dysphemism** | "trade adjustment" vs. "job destruction" | Softening vs. harsh labeling |
| **Acronyms/Technical terms** | "USMCA," "Section 301" | Technicalization, obscuring |

**Coding Questions**:
1. List all referring expressions for each key actor
2. What categories are used? (national, occupational, political, moral)
3. Are there in-group/out-group markers?
4. What is named vs. left unnamed (strategic silences)?

---

### Strategy 2: PREDICATION

**Objective**: How characteristics, qualities, and features are attributed to social actors, objects, phenomena, events, and processes.

**Linguistic Devices to Identify**:

| Device | Examples | What to Look For |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Explicit predicates** | "China is aggressive," "workers are struggling" | Direct attributions |
| **Predicative adjectives** | "unfair practices," "American resilience" | Evaluative modifiers |
| **Predicative nouns** | "cheaters," "victims," "partners" | Role/identity attributions |
| **Presuppositions** | "restore fairness" (presupposes unfairness) | What is taken for granted? |
| **Implicit predicates** | Connotations, collocations | Meanings invoked but not stated |
| **Comparisons/Similes** | "like the 1930s," "as bad as..." | What is compared to what? |
| **Collocations** | "trade deficit," "level playing field" | Habitual word pairings |
| **Stereotypes** | Recurring trait attributions | Standardized characterizations |

**Coding Questions**:
1. What positive traits are attributed to in-group?
2. What negative traits are attributed to out-group?
3. Are attributions explicit or presupposed?
4. What evaluative vocabulary is used?

---

### Strategy 3: ARGUMENTATION

**Objective**: What arguments are employed to justify or legitimize claims about inclusion/exclusion, discrimination, or policy.

**Analysis Procedure**:
1. Identify the **claim** (conclusion being argued for)
2. Identify the **data/evidence** cited
3. Identify the **warrant/topos** connecting data to claim
4. Check for **fallacies** (invalid reasoning)

**Common Topoi (Argumentation Warrants)**:

| Topos | Warrant Structure | Example in Policy Discourse |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Advantage/Usefulness** | If X is useful/beneficial, do X | "Tariffs protect American jobs" |
| **Uselessness/Disadvantage** | If X is not useful/harmful, don't do X | "Free trade destroys manufacturing" |
| **Threat/Danger** | If X is dangerous, act against X | "China threatens our supply chains" |
| **Definition/Name** | If X is called Y, X has Y's qualities | "This is economic warfare" |
| **Authority** | If authority says X, X is valid | "Economists agree that..." |
| **History/Lessons** | History teaches X, so apply X now | "We learned from NAFTA that..." |
| **Numbers/Statistics** | If numbers show X, conclude X | "The $300 billion deficit proves..." |
| **Reality/Facts** | Because reality is X, do/conclude Y | "Manufacturing has declined, so..." |
| **Law/Right** | If X is legal/a right, X is legitimate | "WTO rules permit this response" |
| **Justice/Equity** | If X is unjust, act against X | "Fair trade, not free trade" |
| **Burdening/Weighing** | If X causes burden, reduce burden | "Workers bear the cost of globalization" |
| **Humanitarianism** | If X causes suffering, act against X | "Communities devastated by plant closures" |
| **Urgency** | If X is urgent, act immediately | "We must act now before it's too late" |
| **Finances** | If X costs/saves money, consider X | "Tariffs generate $X billion in revenue" |

**Common Fallacies to Identify**:
- Ad hominem (attack the person)
- Straw man (misrepresent opponent's position)
- False dilemma (only two options presented)
- Slippery slope (exaggerated chain of consequences)
- Appeal to fear/emotion
- Hasty generalization
- Post hoc ergo propter hoc (false causation)

---

### Strategy 4: PERSPECTIVIZATION

**Objective**: How speakers express their involvement in discourse and position their point of view.

**Linguistic Devices to Identify**:

| Device | Examples | What to Look For |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Reporting verbs** | "claims," "admits," "reveals," "argues" | How are others' words framed? |
| **Direct/Indirect speech** | Quotations vs. paraphrase | Whose voice is heard directly? |
| **Epistemic modality** | "certainly," "perhaps," "must be" | Degree of certainty expressed |
| **Deontic modality** | "should," "must," "need to" | Obligation, necessity |
| **Evidentiality markers** | "according to," "reportedly" | Source of knowledge claims |
| **Deixis** | "we/they," "here/there," "now/then" | Speaker positioning |
| **Quotation patterns** | Who is quoted, how often | Whose perspective dominates? |
| **Narrative voice** | First person, third person, passive | Who is telling the story? |

**Coding Questions**:
1. From whose perspective is the account given?
2. How are alternative perspectives represented (or silenced)?
3. What degree of certainty/commitment is expressed?
4. How is the speaker positioned relative to events?

---

### Strategy 5: INTENSIFICATION / MITIGATION

**Objective**: How the illocutionary force of utterances is modified—strengthened or weakened.

**Linguistic Devices to Identify**:

| Type | Devices | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **INTENSIFICATION** | | |
| Emphasizers | "clearly," "obviously," "definitely" | Boosting certainty |
| Superlatives | "the worst," "the greatest," "unprecedented" | Extreme characterization |
| Hyperbole | "disaster," "catastrophe," "invasion" | Exaggeration |
| Repetition | Repeating key terms | Rhetorical emphasis |
| Exclamations | "Enough!" "No more!" | Emotional force |
| **MITIGATION** | | |
| Hedges | "somewhat," "perhaps," "may be" | Reducing commitment |
| Downtoners | "a little," "slightly," "not entirely" | Softening |
| Vague expressions | "some people say," "it seems" | Avoiding specificity |
| Passive voice | "mistakes were made" | Obscuring agency |
| Euphemism | "adjustment," "transition" | Softening impact |
| Modal verbs | "might," "could," "would" | Reducing certainty |

**Coding Questions**:
1. Is the utterance intensified or mitigated?
2. What rhetorical effect does this achieve?
3. What is being emphasized vs. downplayed?
4. Are there patterns across texts/actors?

## Three Types of Critique

Apply these sequentially after completing strategic analysis:

### 1. Text-Immanent Critique
- Identify internal contradictions and inconsistencies
- Note logical fallacies and argumentative gaps
- Document self-contradictions within or across texts

### 2. Socio-Diagnostic Critique
- Demystify ideology embedded in discourse
- Expose manipulation and naturalized assumptions
- Reveal whose interests are served
- Unmask power relations

### 3. Prospective Critique
- Propose how communication could be improved
- Suggest more egalitarian/inclusive alternatives
- Consider transformative possibilities

## Triangulation Checklist

Before finalizing analysis, verify triangulation across:

- [ ] **Data triangulation**: Multiple text types, sources, time periods
- [ ] **Theory triangulation**: Multiple theoretical perspectives considered
- [ ] **Method triangulation**: Qualitative close reading + quantitative patterns
- [ ] **Researcher triangulation**: (If applicable) Multiple analysts compared
- [ ] **Background triangulation**: Historical, political, sociological context integrated

---

## Quality Standards

1. **Evidence-based**: Every claim supported by textual evidence
2. **Systematic**: All texts analyzed using same categories
3. **Transparent**: Coding decisions documented and justified
4. **Reflexive**: Analyst's position acknowledged
5. **Contextual**: Findings integrated with historical/political context
6. **Critical**: All three types of critique applied
