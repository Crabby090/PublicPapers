# Discursive Justification of 2025 U.S. Tariff Policy - Outline

## Research Question

**How does the American government discursively justify its 2025 tariff policies?**

Sub-questions:
- What discursive strategies (nomination, predication, argumentation, perspectivization, intensification) are employed?
- What topoi (argumentation warrants) legitimize the tariff regime?
- How are social actors (trading partners, American workers, foreign adversaries) constructed?
- What historical narratives are mobilized to justify the "national emergency" framing?
- How does discourse shift across genres (Executive Orders vs. Fact Sheets vs. Truth Social)?

## Contribution / Thesis

This paper applies Wodak and Reisigl's Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) to analyze how the Trump administration (2025) constructs tariffs as necessary, legitimate, and beneficial through official government discourse. We argue that the administration:

1. **Frames trade deficits as existential threat** using the topos of danger/national emergency
2. **Constructs a moralized us/them binary** (hardworking Americans vs. unfair trading partners)
3. **Invokes historical reciprocity narratives** to legitimize departure from post-war trade consensus
4. **Deploys intensification strategies** ("beautiful," "crisis," "emergency") to heighten affective stakes

## Key Claims (tie to evidence IDs)

- **C1**: The discourse constructs trade deficits as a "national emergency" threatening security, not merely an economic imbalance. [Sources: 1, 2, 6]
- **C2**: Trading partners are predicated negatively through terms like "non-reciprocal," "unfair," while China is singled out as a "non-market economy" and implicit adversary. [Sources: 2, 6, 44-48]
- **C3**: The topos of reciprocity ("treat us like we treat you") serves as the master warrant, framing tariffs as restoring justice rather than imposing protectionism. [Sources: 1, 2, 6]
- **C4**: The topos of numbers (trade deficit figures, tariff rate comparisons) provides ostensibly objective legitimation. [Sources: 1, 2, 6]
- **C5**: Intensification strategies ("beautiful thing," "unsustainable crisis") heighten the emotional register beyond technocratic policy discourse. [Sources: 44-48]
- **C6**: The discourse shifts register across genres: legal-bureaucratic in EOs, promotional in Fact Sheets, populist-affective on Truth Social. [Corpus-wide]

## Corpus Description

| Genre | Count | Sources | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Executive Orders | ~12 | [1, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 38, 39, 42] | Legal authority, formal justification |
| Fact Sheets | ~7 | [2, 13, 15, 17, 20, 40] | Public communication, key message distillation |
| Joint Statements | ~6 | [11, 32-37] | Diplomatic framing, bilateral success narratives |
| CBP Guidance | ~10 | [22-31] | Implementation, technical/bureaucratic register |
| Truth Social Posts | ~5 days | [44-48] | Direct presidential voice, populist-affective register |
| House Document | 1 | [43] | Congressional notification, constitutional framing |

**Time span**: April 2, 2025 - December 2025
**Primary actors**: President Trump, White House, CBP

## Analytical Framework (DHA)

### Four Levels of Context

1. **Text-internal**: Linguistic features, co-text
2. **Intertextual**: Relations between EOs, Fact Sheets, social media
3. **Institutional**: White House, CBP, Federal Register conventions
4. **Socio-historical**: Post-war trade system, Trump 1.0 tariffs, 2024 election, US-China tensions

### Five Discursive Strategies to Analyze

| Strategy | Preliminary Observations from Corpus |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Nomination** | "trading partners," "foreign adversaries," "non-market economies," "hardworking Americans," "our manufacturing base" |
| **Predication** | Trade deficit as "unsustainable crisis," tariffs as "beautiful," access as "privilege not right" |
| **Argumentation** | Topoi of threat, reciprocity, numbers, history, justice, advantage |
| **Perspectivization** | First-person plural ("our"), authoritative presidential voice, "I, DONALD J. TRUMP" |
| **Intensification** | "emergency," "beautiful thing to behold," "hollowing out," superlatives |

### Key Topoi to Track

- Topos of threat/danger (national emergency, security)
- Topos of reciprocity/justice ("golden rule," fairness)
- Topos of numbers (deficit figures, tariff rate comparisons)
- Topos of history (1934-1994 trade policy narrative)
- Topos of advantage (jobs, manufacturing, economic growth)
- Topos of authority (IEEPA, presidential power)

## Open Questions

- Should we include industry responses (business lobbying, press coverage) as counter-discourse?
- How to handle the quantitative data (trade statistics CSVs) - integrate or separate analysis?
- Should we narrow to a specific sub-corpus (e.g., just April 2025 rollout) for depth?
- How to handle Truth Social's informal register in systematic analysis?

## Next Steps

1. Complete contextual analysis (Level 4 context document)
2. Conduct pilot analysis on 3-4 key texts (EO 14257, April 2 Fact Sheet, April 6 Truth Social)
3. Develop coding scheme based on pilot
4. Systematic analysis of full corpus
5. Draft findings
