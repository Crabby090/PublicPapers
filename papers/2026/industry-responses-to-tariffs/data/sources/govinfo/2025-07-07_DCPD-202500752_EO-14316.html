Trump, 2025</p><h1 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Executive Order 14316—Extending the Modification of the Reciprocal Tariff Rates</h1><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">July 7, 2025</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <i>et seq</i>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <i>et seq</i>.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Section 1. Background<span class="p">. In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States. I declared a national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat I imposed additional ad valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provides that, &quot;[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters, I may further modify the [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States] to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment), I determined that it was necessary and appropriate to temporarily suspend, for a period of 90 days, application of the additional ad valorem rate of duties for products of the foreign trading partners listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, except with respect to the People&#39;s Republic of China (PRC), and to instead impose on articles of all such trading partners an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent, subject to the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended. I made this determination in light of the &quot;sincere intentions&quot; and willingness of these trading partners to address the national and economic security concerns of the United States. This 90-day suspension expires at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 9, 2025.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">I have determined, based on additional information and recommendations from various senior officials, including information on the status of discussions with trading partners, that it is necessary and appropriate to extend the suspension effectuated by Executive Order 14266 until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025. With respect to the PRC, the separate tariff suspension effectuated by Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People&#39;s Republic of China), remains in effect and is unaltered by this order.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Sec. 2. Tariff Modifications<span class="p">. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified, effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 9, 2025, by suspending headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, and subdivisions (v)(xiii)(1)–(9) and (11)–(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Sec. 3.
