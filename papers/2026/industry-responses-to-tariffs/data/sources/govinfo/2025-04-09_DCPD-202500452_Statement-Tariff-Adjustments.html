At some point—hopefully, in the near future—China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 countries have called representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to trade, trade barriers, tariffs, currency manipulation, and nonmonetary tariffs—and that these countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States—I have authorized a 90-day pause and a substantially lowered reciprocal tariff during this period of 10 percent, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 147%;text-align: left;">Categories: <span class="p">Statements by the President : U.S. tariff adjustments</span>.
