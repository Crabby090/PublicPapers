Trump, 2025</p><h1 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Executive Order 14298—Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People&#39;s Republic of China</h1><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">May 12, 2025</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <i>et seq</i>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <i>et seq</i>.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Section 1<span class="p">. </span>Background<span class="p">. In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional </span>ad valorem <span class="p">duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and economy of the United States. Section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257 provided that &quot;[s]hould any trading partner retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S. exports or other measures, I may further modify the [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States] to increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People&#39;s Republic of China), and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment), pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257, I ordered modifications of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable <i>ad valorem </i>duty rate for imports from the People&#39;s Republic of China (PRC) established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the State Council Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that it would retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14257 and Executive Order 14259.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provided that, &quot;[s]hould any trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters, I may further modify the HTSUS to decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.&quot; Since I signed Executive Order 14266, the United States has entered into discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns. Conducting these discussions is a significant step by the PRC toward remedying non- reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the concerns of the United States relating to economic and national security matters.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Pursuant to section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS to suspend for a period of 90 days application of the additional <i>ad valorem </i>duties imposed on the PRC listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, as amended by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, and clarified in the Presidential Memorandum of April 11, 2025 (Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as Amended), and to instead impose on articles of the PRC an additional <i>ad valorem </i>rate of duty as set forth herein,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided in, Executive Order 14257, as modified by this order.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Sec. 2<span class="p">. </span>Suspension of Country-Specific Ad Valorem Rate of Duty<span class="p">.

This <i>ad valorem </i>rate of duty of 10 percent reflects (i) the modification of the application of the additional <i>ad valorem </i>rate of duty on articles of China (including articles of Hong Kong and Macau) set forth in Executive Order 14257, by suspending 24 percentage points of that rate for an initial period of 90 days, and the retention of the remaining <i>ad valorem </i>rate of 10 percent on those articles pursuant to the terms of said order; and (ii) the removal of the modified additional <i>ad valorem </i>rates of duty on those articles imposed by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Sec. 3<span class="p">. </span>Tariff Modifications<span class="p">.
