# "A Beautiful Thing to Behold": The Discursive Construction of Reciprocity in U.S. Tariff Policy (2025)

## Abstract

This paper applies the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) to analyze how the Trump administration discursively justified its 2025 "reciprocal tariff" policy. Drawing on 41 official documents spanning Executive Orders, Fact Sheets, Truth Social posts, and diplomatic statements, we examine the discursive strategies employed to legitimize tariffs declared under emergency powers. Our analysis reveals "reciprocity" functions as the master topos, framing protectionist measures as restorative justice. The discourse constructs trade deficits as existential security threats, employs a moralized us/them binary, and mobilizes historical narratives to justify departure from post-war trade consensus. We find significant register variation across genres while core ideological content remains stable. The study contributes to critical discourse studies by demonstrating how emergency powers framing securitizes trade policy, with implications for democratic deliberation.

## 1. Introduction

On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and imposed sweeping tariffs on virtually all U.S. trading partners. Executive Order 14257 invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify tariff rates ranging from 10% to 145% [1, 3]. The action marked one of the most significant unilateral shifts in U.S. trade policy since the post-war establishment of the multilateral trading system, affecting trillions of dollars in global commerce and provoking retaliatory measures from major trading partners. This paper asks: **How does the American government discursively justify its 2025 tariff policies?** Following the critical discourse studies tradition, we examine not whether the tariffs are economically sound or legally defensible, but how official government discourse constructs them as necessary, legitimate, and beneficial.

Critical discourse studies has developed sophisticated frameworks for analyzing populist political communication [16, 21, 22], and several studies have examined Trump's trade discourse specifically [10, 11]. Yet existing analyses focus on either specific platforms (Twitter/X), narrow document types (Trade Policy Agendas), or non-discourse-analytic frameworks (negotiation theory, economics). No prior study has applied full Discourse-Historical Approach methodology to the 2025 tariff discourse. More fundamentally, existing work has not examined how this discourse attempts to transform trade policy from technocratic economic debate into a domain of national security and existential threat, a discursive move with significant implications for democratic deliberation.

The Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) offers tools well-suited to address this gap [14]. DHA emphasizes the historical dimension of discourse formation, which matters here since the administration positions its policy against decades of trade liberalization while claiming continuity with earlier "reciprocity" traditions. It provides systematic analytical categories (nomination, predication, argumentation, perspectivization, intensification) that enable rigorous examination of how social actors are constructed and legitimized. And as Forchtner [19] has elaborated, DHA's grounding in Frankfurt School critical theory provides a normative basis for critique rooted in communicative rationality rather than arbitrary political preference.

We apply DHA to a corpus of 41 official documents produced between April and November 2025, spanning Executive Orders, Fact Sheets, Truth Social posts, and diplomatic statements. This multi-genre approach enables examination of how the same policy is framed differently across institutional settings while maintaining discursive coherence. Following Krzyżanowski's [23] call for CDS to attend to the "metapolitical dimension" of discourse, we examine not just what is said but how the terrain of political contestation is shaped.

Our analysis reveals that "reciprocity" functions as the master topos, framing protectionist measures as restorative justice. The discourse constructs trade deficits as existential security threats, employs a moralized us/them binary, and exhibits significant register variation from legal formality to populist intensity. Most consequentially, the securitization of trade policy through emergency powers framing removes economic debate from ordinary democratic contestation. These findings contribute to CDS's engagement with populist discourse while demonstrating how emergency powers framing can reshape the conditions of deliberation.

## 2. Critical Discourse Studies and Trade Policy: Prior Research and Gaps

Critical discourse studies has increasingly engaged with populist political communication. As Krzyżanowski [21] notes in the *Critical Discourse Studies* special issue on populism, the field has moved beyond treating populism as mere demagoguery toward understanding it as a distinctive discursive logic. Wodak's [16, 22] extensive work identifies recurring patterns: homogeneous in-groups threatened by dangerous out-groups; appeals to "common sense" against expert knowledge; transgressive communication styles; and strategic deployment of fear. Her recent work on the "shameless normalization" of far-right discourse [22] traces how once-marginal rhetorical moves have entered mainstream political communication.

Guardino's [20] analysis of "neoliberal populism" provides an important precedent. Examining Reagan's 1981 economic plan, Guardino demonstrates how populist and neoliberal elements were fused in official policy talk, with "the American people" discursively constructed as anti-statist market subjects through "trans-coding" of populist signifiers. This fusion of populist rhetoric with economic policy discourse anticipates patterns we observe in the 2025 tariff discourse, albeit with different ideological content.

Several studies have examined Trump's trade discourse specifically. Di Tella and Rodrik [10] analyzed Trump's Twitter during the 2018 steel and aluminum tariff announcements, finding that populist foreign policy themes generated polarized networks along elite-versus-people divides. Hu and Li [11] applied Critical Discourse Analysis to Trade Policy Agendas from 2017-2019, demonstrating how China was progressively reframed from "distant trade partner" to "proximate adversary" through shifting deictic positioning.

More recently, Smolinski et al. [12] examined the April 2025 tariffs from a negotiation theory perspective, identifying "distorted or selectively presented information" and "performative negotiation" as key features. Grossman and Sykes [13] offered an economic critique arguing that the tariffs fail the core requirements for emergency powers. Despite this growing literature, no prior study has applied full DHA methodology to the 2025 tariff discourse across multiple genres, which is our contribution.

## 3. Theoretical Framework and Methodology

### 3.1 The Discourse-Historical Approach

The Discourse-Historical Approach, developed by Wodak and colleagues at the University of Vienna, integrates Frankfurt School critical theory with systematic linguistic analysis [14, 16]. As Forchtner [19] has elaborated, DHA's critical stance is grounded in Habermasian communicative rationality: the commitment to discourse free from domination, where validity claims can be raised and contested openly. We evaluate discourse against standards of truthfulness, appropriateness, and openness to contestation rather than imposing external political judgments.

Three features of DHA suit analyzing tariff discourse. First, DHA emphasizes **historical context**, situating discourse within longer trajectories of meaning-making. This matters here because the 2025 tariffs position themselves against decades of trade liberalization while claiming continuity with earlier "reciprocity" traditions. Second, DHA provides five **discursive strategies** as analytical categories: nomination, predication, argumentation, perspectivization, and intensification/mitigation. Third, DHA attends to **intertextuality**, examining how texts reference and recontextualize each other. This helps explain how an Executive Order becomes a Fact Sheet becomes a Truth Social post: the same policy articulated across registers. Following van Dijk [15], we also employ the **ideological square** to analyze how discourse emphasizes positive in-group and negative out-group characteristics.

Our analysis engages with **securitization theory** as developed by the Copenhagen School [24]. Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde conceptualize securitization as a speech act that moves issues from ordinary politics into emergency measures, where normal rules of democratic deliberation can be suspended. A successful securitization requires an existential threat claim, emergency measures that would not otherwise be legitimate, and acceptance by a relevant audience. Copenhagen School analysis focuses on speech act conditions; DHA complements this by illuminating the linguistic mechanisms through which securitizing moves are accomplished.

### 3.2 Corpus and Analytical Procedure

Our corpus comprises 41 official documents from April 2-November 14, 2025, spanning six genres: **Executive Orders** (12 documents) providing formal justification and legal authority; **White House Fact Sheets** (7 documents) translating legal-bureaucratic discourse into promotional register; **Joint Statements** (6 documents) representing diplomatic discourse of accommodation; **CBP Guidance** (10 documents) providing technical implementation instructions; **Truth Social Posts** (5 days sampled during the April rollout, plus April 30) representing populist-affective register; and **House Document** (1 document) providing congressional notification.

We followed DHA's eight-stage research programme [14], proceeding iteratively with constant comparison between preliminary findings and textual evidence. As critical discourse analysts, we acknowledge our own positioning shapes the analysis; we approach this discourse with commitments to democratic deliberation and concern about the securitization of economic policy. Following DHA's grounding in communicative rationality [19], our critique targets discursive practices that foreclose contestation rather than policy conclusions themselves.

## 4. Analysis

### 4.1 The National Emergency Frame: Securitizing Trade Policy

The foundational discursive move of the 2025 tariff policy is **securitization**: transforming trade imbalances from economic policy questions into security emergencies. Executive Order 14257 declares that trade deficits "constitute an **unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy** of the United States" [3]. This securitization enables invocation of IEEPA, which grants the President unilateral authority normally reserved for genuine crises like war or terrorism. The discourse must therefore construct trade deficits as crisis-level threats.

It does so through expansive threat predication extending far beyond economics. The Executive Order links trade deficits to military vulnerability ("compromised military readiness," "our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries"), social decay ("decline in rates of family formation," "the rise of... the abuse of opioids"), and supply chain fragility ("undermined critical supply chains") [3]. This expansive threat construction exemplifies what Wodak [16, 22] identifies as central to right-wing populist discourse: transforming technocratic debate into existential struggle for national survival.

The socio-historical context positions current policy as corrective restoration rather than protectionist innovation. The Order frames the policy against "three incorrect assumptions" of the post-war trading system: "that if the United States led the world in liberalizing tariff and non-tariff barriers the rest of the world would follow," "that such liberalization would ultimately result in more economic convergence," and "that as a result, the United States would not accrue large and persistent goods trade deficits" [3].

The narrative arc presents an original commitment to reciprocity (1934), gradual betrayal through post-war multilateralism, and current policy as restoration of founding principles. Truth Social reinforces this temporal framing: "The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO" [7]. The policy appears not as departure from American tradition but as return to it. This historical topos preempts accusations of radicalism by positioning the most significant unilateral shift in post-war trade policy as conservative restoration.

### 4.2 Nomination and Predication: Constructing the Ideological Square

The discourse constructs a unified American identity through collective possessives and sympathetic categorizations. The repeated phrase "our manufacturing base" appears alongside "our trading partners," "our defense-industrial base," and "our country" [3], interpellating readers into a shared national subject position. More specifically, the discourse privileges particular Americans: "hardworking Americans" [2], "the workers here in America" [7], "American workers" [3].

The April 8 Truth Social post crystallizes populist nomination: "I'm proud to be the President for the workers, not the outsourcers; the President who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street; who protects the middle class, not the political class; and who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe" [8]. This passage exhibits the characteristic populist structure Krzyżanowski [21] identifies: the construction of "the people" against multiple enemies. It exemplifies what Wodak [16] terms "synecdochical" nationalism, where specific social groups stand for the nation, and echoes patterns Guardino [20] identified in Reagan-era discourse.

Foreign actors are nominated along a graduated hostility scale. Executive Order language employs relatively neutral terms ("trading partners") while delegitimizing certain actors through categorization ("non-market economies like China" [3]), implicitly questioning China's legitimacy by denying it market status. The populist register intensifies hostility; Truth Social refers to "the biggest abuser of them all, China" [7] and "trade cheaters all over the globe" [8].

The April 9 Statement on raising China tariffs to 125% deploys explicitly moral language: "Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets, I am hereby raising the tariff... the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable" [4]. The progression from "trading partners" to "abusers" to those who "rip off" illustrates how nomination intensifies across registers while maintaining ideological consistency.

Equally significant is what remains unnamed. Consumers are almost entirely absent from the discourse, with focus remaining on producers and workers. U.S. industries harmed by tariffs (those dependent on imported inputs) go unmentioned. Most strikingly, the term "protectionism" never appears, replaced entirely by "reciprocity." These silences shape what becomes thinkable: if consumers are not named, consumer harm cannot enter deliberation; if "protectionism" is unspeakable, the policy cannot be criticized on those terms.

The trade deficit receives uniformly negative predication through crisis vocabulary: "unsustainable crisis" [2], "hollowing out of our manufacturing base" [3], "atrophy of domestic production capacity" [3]. The organic metaphors ("hollowing out," "atrophy") construct the nation as a body being weakened. The discourse predicates social pathologies as effects: "decline in rates of family formation" and "the rise of... the abuse of opioids" [3]. This causal claim, linking trade policy to family breakdown and drug addiction, extends economic harm into moral-social harm.

Tariffs themselves receive strikingly positive predication, not merely defended but aestheticized. Truth Social describes tariffs as "a beautiful thing to behold" [6] and "beautiful and efficient process" [8]. The Fact Sheet frames them as "a cornerstone of his campaign from the start" [2], emphasizing democratic mandate. Their effects are predicated positively: "bringing in Billions of Dollars a week" [7]. Their necessity is absolute: "the only way this problem can be cured" [6].

Perhaps the most consequential predication appears in the April 2 Fact Sheet: "Access to the American market is a privilege, not a right" [2]. Under the post-war trading system, market access was constructed as mutual benefit. This predication transforms access into unilateral grant, positioning the United States as gatekeeper dispensing privileges rather than partner in exchange. Privileges can be revoked; rights require justification for their removal.

### 4.3 Argumentation: The Topoi of Reciprocity, Threat, and Numbers

The argumentation mobilizes several interlocking topoi, with **reciprocity** functioning as the master warrant. The topos appears in the policy's title ("Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices") and receives moral elaboration: "He is the first President in modern history to stand strong for hardworking Americans by asking other countries to follow the golden rule on trade: Treat us like we treat you" [2]. The "golden rule" framing transforms economic policy into ethical imperative.

The logic proceeds through comparison: U.S. tariffs are among "the lowest simple average MFN tariff rates in the world at 3.3 percent," while others charge more (Brazil 11.2%, China 7.5%, EU 5%, India 17%) [3]. Therefore, U.S. tariff increases restore reciprocity rather than impose protectionism. As Heiduk and Ebert [17] observe, trade functions as a "floating signifier" in populist discourse. "Reciprocal tariffs" exploits this ambiguity: critics hear protectionism; supporters hear fairness enforced.

The **topos of threat/danger** pervades the discourse. Trade deficits are linked to military vulnerability ("our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries"), supply chain fragility ("undermined critical supply chains"), and global instability ("the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad") [3]. The warrant operates as commonsense assumption: who would oppose measures to protect national security?

The **topos of numbers** provides ostensible objective legitimation through quantitative saturation: the "$1.2 trillion" trade deficit that has "grown by over 40 percent in the past 5 years" [3]; the "5 million manufacturing jobs" lost between 1997 and 2024 [3]; detailed tariff rate comparisons (U.S. passenger vehicles at 2.5% versus EU at 10%, India at 70%) [3]. These numbers construct an appearance of facticity, though economists dispute both the figures and causal claims [13].

### 4.4 Perspectivization, Intensification, and Genre Variation

Executive Orders employ formal first-person singular to maximize presidential authority: "I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that..." [3]. This formulaic opening positions the President as singular actor making definitive findings. Collective deixis pervades the discourse ("our manufacturing base," "our country"), with "we" strategically oscillating between administration and nation, blurring the distinction between presidential action and national interest.

Truth Social extensively employs reported speech to construct popular support: "the ranchers of Wyoming are saying thank you Mr. President, it is about time!" [7]. This strategy "democratizes" endorsement, presenting ordinary Americans as spontaneously validating the policy. The President ventriloquizes the people.

The discourse deploys extensive intensification: superlatives ("the biggest abuser of them all" [7]), hyperbole reaching aesthetic registers ("beautiful thing to behold" [6]), Truth Social's characteristic capitalization ("TARIFFS," "DECADES AGO," "CHINA!!!" [6-9]), and crisis vocabulary pervading formal documents ("national emergency," "unsustainable crisis," "hollowing out," "atrophy").

Mitigation appears primarily in diplomatic contexts. The US-China Geneva Joint Statement employs hedged formulae: "Recognizing the importance of their bilateral economic and trade relationship... Moving forward in the spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect..." [5]. The asymmetry is significant: intensification dominates justificatory discourse for domestic audiences; mitigation appears only in negotiation contexts, suggesting strategic deployment where intensity mobilizes support while moderation enables diplomatic flexibility.

Following Fairclough's [25] understanding of genre, we analyze how register variation accomplishes distinct functions. The **legal register** legitimizes by invoking statutory authority. The **promotional register** mobilizes by distilling key messages; Fact Sheets transform legal prose into memorable formulations ("Access to the American market is a privilege, not a right"). The **populist register** energizes by appealing to affect; Truth Social's informal address constructs intimacy between President and "the people."

The **technical register** implements by providing operational guidance stripped of justificatory content. CBP documents focus on procedures (tariff codes, effective dates), treating the policy as already decided. This bureaucratic neutrality performs ideological work: by treating tariffs as purely procedural, CBP guidance naturalizes the policy. There is no "why," only "how." The absence of justification implies none is needed.

The **diplomatic register** accommodates by enabling negotiation; Joint Statements employ hedged formulations allowing face-saving flexibility. Yet while register varies, core strategies remain stable across genres. "Reciprocity" appears in Executive Orders, Fact Sheets, and Truth Social alike. The us/them binary persists across registers. This pattern suggests strategic recontextualization: ideological content translated into genre-appropriate forms, maximizing reach while maintaining coherence.

The corpus exhibits clear intertextual chains. EO 14257 establishes the discursive template. The April 2 Fact Sheet paraphrases the Executive Order, transforming legal prose into promotional bullet points; the causal claims transfer intact, only register changes. Truth Social exhibits a different relationship: selective amplification. The "golden rule" formulation reappears with intensified affect: "We're asking for the simple Golden Rule of Trade, treat us like we treat you" [7].

Later Executive Orders explicitly reference earlier ones, citing "the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257" and treating the initial securitization as established fact. Each subsequent text presupposes and reinforces the framework established by its predecessors.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 "Reciprocity" as Ideological Legitimation

Our analysis reveals that "reciprocity" functions as the master frame unifying the tariff discourse, performing significant ideological work by transforming protectionist measures into justice claims and preempting critiques by positioning opposition as defending unfairness. The "golden rule" framing exemplifies this moral recoding of economic policy; who could oppose treating others as we wish to be treated? Yet the discourse's own construction of "reciprocity" reveals its selective character. True reciprocity would involve symmetrical treatment; the discourse constructs asymmetrical victimhood (the U.S. uniquely exploited) requiring asymmetrical response (the U.S. uniquely entitled to impose tariffs). This is what van Dijk [15] terms the ideological square in operation: emphasizing negative characteristics of out-groups (unfair trading practices) while de-emphasizing context (U.S. benefits from existing arrangements, consumer gains from imports, costs of retaliation).

### 5.2 Securitization and Democratic Deliberation

The securitization move represents the discourse's most consequential achievement. As Wang [18] argues, populism, securitization, and realist foreign policy form an interconnected complex. By constructing trade as security threat, the discourse accesses extraordinary powers (IEEPA grants authority bypassing congressional deliberation), elevates stakes beyond technocratic debate, and delegitimizes opposition (critics appear insufficiently protective of national security).

Grossman and Sykes [13] correctly note this securitization fails on its own terms: the order does not identify an "unusual and extraordinary threat" as IEEPA requires. Yet discursively, the securitization succeeds. It establishes the frame within which subsequent debate must occur. To contest the tariffs, one must first contest the emergency framing, a more difficult argumentative task than debating policy merits.

### 5.3 Alternative Interpretations and Contribution to CDS

Several counter-interpretations warrant consideration. One might argue that the "reciprocity" framing reflects genuine belief rather than strategic construction. DHA does not require attributing conscious manipulation; discourses can be ideologically consequential while being sincerely held. Our analysis concerns the discourse's effects regardless of speaker intentions.

The discourse could be defended on its own terms: trade deficits do threaten national security through defense industrial base dependency; "reciprocity" accurately describes the policy goal; emergency powers were legally appropriate. Our critique targets not these substantive claims but discursive practices that present contestable assertions as self-evident facts and invoke emergency framing to bypass deliberation. The question is not whether tariffs are good policy but whether the discourse enables democratic contestation.

The register variation we identify could reflect routine institutional adaptation; different genres have different conventions. This is partially valid. However, our analysis shows that while register varies, ideological content remains stable across genres, suggesting variation serves consistent messaging rather than reflecting independent institutional logics.

Our analysis extends CDS's engagement with populist discourse into economic policy. Building on Guardino's [20] analysis of neoliberal populism, we show how similar patterns operate in contemporary tariff discourse. Four decades separate Reagan's tax cuts and Trump's tariffs, yet discursive strategies exhibit notable stability. Following Wodak [22] on the "shameless normalization" of far-right discourse, we document how transgressive rhetorical moves appear in official government communications: aesthetic celebration of tariffs, explicit hostility to trading partners, affective mobilization against foreign "abusers."

The patterns we identify have implications beyond this policy. When trade policy is securitized, deliberation shifts from congressional to executive authority, from economic evidence to security assertion, from technocratic debate to moral confrontation. The rhetorical intensity mobilizes affect rather than inviting analysis.

From the perspective of communicative rationality [19], these discursive practices are troubling not because we oppose policy conclusions but because they foreclose genuine deliberation. Claims that should be contestable are asserted as fact. Categories that should be argued are presupposed. Alternatives that should be debated are rendered unspeakable.

## 6. Limitations

Several limitations constrain this analysis. We focus exclusively on government discourse; industry responses, media coverage, and opposition voices remain unexamined. A fuller account would trace how these discourses interact and contest each other. Our temporal snapshot (April-November 2025) may not capture evolving patterns as negotiations proceeded.

As Forchtner [19] emphasizes, DHA's critical stance requires reflexivity about the analyst's positioning. We approach this discourse with commitments to democratic deliberation and concern about securitization. We have attempted to ground critique in communicative rationality rather than policy preference, but readers should evaluate our interpretations against the textual evidence. DHA's qualitative focus provides depth at the cost of generalizability; claims about broader patterns require comparative analysis.

---

## 7. Conclusion

This paper has applied the Discourse-Historical Approach to analyze how the Trump administration discursively justified its 2025 "reciprocal tariff" policy. "Reciprocity" functions as the master topos, framing protectionist measures as restorative justice through appeals to the "golden rule." The discourse constructs trade deficits as existential security threats, employs a moralized us/them binary, mobilizes historical narratives of betrayed reciprocity, and exhibits significant register variation from legal formality to populist intensity.

The securitization of trade policy through emergency powers represents the foundational discursive move. By declaring trade deficits a "national emergency," the discourse transforms economic questions into security imperatives, accessing executive authority while delegitimizing opposition. This discursive achievement shapes the terrain on which subsequent debate must occur.

For critical discourse studies, this analysis demonstrates how DHA's categories can illuminate contemporary political discourse while maintaining normative grounding. The patterns we identify offer analytical resources applicable beyond this case. Future research might examine counter-discourses from industry and media, trace discursive evolution as negotiations proceeded, or compare across national contexts. Understanding how trade policy is discursively constructed remains essential for informed democratic engagement.
