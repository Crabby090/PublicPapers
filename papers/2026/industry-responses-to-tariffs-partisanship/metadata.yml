abstract: "This paper examines whether U.S. industries with different workforce partisanship responded differently to the 2018-2019 tariff shocks. We build a NAICS-3 panel combining Census trade time series data with an industry-level partisanship proxy based on county presidential vote shares weighted by county employment. We add tariff exposure using Section 301 lists mapped from HTS to NAICS and a rigidity proxy based on employment per establishment. Using cross-sectional pre/post change models, panel fixed effects, and event-study interactions, we test for differential trade adjustments by industry partisanship and evaluate exposure, rigidity, pre-trends, and geographic exposure. The results show a negative association for exports in weighted cross-sections, while panel and pre-trend diagnostics suggest substantial uncertainty. The paper emphasizes data construction, measurement choices, and robustness checks and provides a transparent analysis pipeline for replication."
