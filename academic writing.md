# Academic Writing

## Overview

Produce academic prose that follows a strict structure and length constraints while maintaining readable variation in sentence length. Apply the introduction blueprint and quality checks below whenever drafting or revising.

## Core Style Requirements

- Target paragraph length: 150-200 words.
- Allow occasional short paragraphs when it improves emphasis or readability.
- Vary sentence length within each paragraph to avoid monotony.
- When uncertain about journal norms, consult example articles from the target journal if browsing is allowed; otherwise ask the user for samples.

## Introduction Blueprint (4-5 paragraphs, optional 6th)

Use this exact ordering unless the user provides a different structure:

1. Topic and research objective.
2. Problematize how existing research has addressed the topic.
3. Elaborate on ways forward for research (implicitly foreshadow the paper's approach).
4. Present the paper's approach and show how it resolves the tension.
5. State the core contribution.
6. (Optional) Outline the structure of the paper.

## Drafting Workflow

1. Confirm scope: topic, field, target journal (if any), citation style, total word count, and required sections.
2. Draft a brief outline that matches the requested structure.
3. Write paragraphs to length targets, varying sentence length and pacing.
4. Verify references: never invent sources; only cite what the user provides or explicitly approves.
5. Re-check word counts against requirements.

## Quality Checks (always run)

- Enforce paragraph length targets; justify any intentionally short paragraphs.
- Confirm total length aligns with requirements (papers usually 6,000-9,000 words unless specified otherwise).
- Confirm correct reference usage and consistency (citation style, spelling of author names, dates).
- Flag missing evidence or references instead of fabricating them.

## Output Handling

- If the user asks for a specific word count, obey it even if it conflicts with the default range.
- If the user provides sample text, mirror its tone and structure.
